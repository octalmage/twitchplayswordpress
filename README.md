It all started with a Tweet.

Ever since I saw [Twitch Plays Pokemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon) I've wanted to make something similar. The project is genius and it inspired me. I work with WordPress everyday and last week I had an idea, what if Twitch could create a website? I would stream the WordPress backend, and let Twitch control the mouse and keyboard using the chat. After talking to a few people I got excided about the concept and I decided to do it. Within a few hours I had [a working demo](https://github.com/octalmage/twitchplayswordpress/commit/b9ebc9a93c49c9f71f3e7844f6d0298dab0a68fd).
